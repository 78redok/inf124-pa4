PA 4: Building a single page application with React, Express, and Sequelize

For this assignment, we used React, node.js, express, and sequelize to create an admin website that would allow us to add new products to our website which will then be subsequently displayed in their respective pages. The client (React) section of our assignment handles the front-end while the back-end server uses Node.js.

Requirements:
1. Our admin page allows the user to add a product to the system. All attributes of a product can be added through the admin form. This includes a game's name, price, description, platform, release month, and image. After hitting submit, the game's information will appear in the connected MySQL database. This database is also connected to PA3, where any submitted product will also be displayed alongside previously entered product details.
2. The user will be able to select any existing products within the database through the admin page. Selecting an existing product allows the user to view any details associated with it. The user may also choose to update any of the details and changes made will be reflected within the connected MySQL database.
3. Users will also have the option to delete any existing products. Deleting the product will also delete it from the connected MySQL database.
4. There are a total of three filter options for products that already exist within the database. This includes being able to filter by name, platform, and release month.
5. The admin page's CSS reflects the original website's design schemes in color, style, and feel.

* Omitted node_nodules folder as per instructions given on the assignment page.
